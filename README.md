# Installation
All libraries needed to run the code including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. They are all standard libraries in data science using python.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in using Seattle AirBNB data in the year of 2016 to understand the following question:
1. What is the busiest time to visit Seattle, and does it relate to airbnb price?
2. Follow the last question, is there any obvious trend in the Airbnb listings and visitors?
3. What factors in a listing contributed to the price?
4. How can we predict the price of a listing?
# File Descriptions
There are three notebooks here to describe the whole work process to answer the three above questions. The first file "price-availability.ipynb" shows the exploratory work to find the trend of airbnb price and airbnb property availability, and also their connections. The second file "price-factors.ipynb" described the correlation and impact of other numerical and categorical variables on the listing price. The third file "price-model-pca.ipynb" shows models built to predict the price and the parameter tuning process. Markdown cells were used to describe some details in data exploratory, data cleaning, dimension reduction, and modeling.

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
I will give credit to Stack Overflow for some of the code and airbnb, udacity, and kaggle for the data. 
You can find the licensing for the data and other information at the Kaggle link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).
