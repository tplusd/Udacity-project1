# Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in using Seattle AirBNB data in the year of 2016 to understand the following question:
1. What is the busiest time to visit Seattle, and does it relate to airbnb price?
2. Follow the last question, is there any obvious trend in the Airbnb listings and visitors?
3. What factors in a listing contributed to the price?
4. How can we predict the price of a listing?
