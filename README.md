# Installation
All libraries needed to run the code including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. They are all standard libraries in data science using python.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I am interested in using Seattle AirBNB data in the year of 2016 to understand the following question:
1. What is the busiest time to visit Seattle, and does it relate to AirBnB price? Is there any obvious trend in the AirBnB listings and visitors?
2. What factors in a listing contributed to the price?
3. How can we predict the price of a listing?
# File Descriptions
There are three notebooks here to describe the whole work process to answer the three above questions. The first file "price-availability.ipynb" shows the exploratory work to find the trend of AirBnB price and AirBnB property availability, and also their connections. The second file "price-factors.ipynb" described the correlation and impact of other numerical and categorical variables on the listing price. The third file "price-model-pca.ipynb" shows models built to predict the price and the parameter tuning process. Markdown cells were used to describe some details in data exploratory, data cleaning, dimension reduction, and modeling.

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
I will give credit to Stack Overflow for some of the code and AirBnB, udacity, and kaggle for the data.
